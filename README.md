# Using Luma3DS with Plugin Loader
1. Download Luma3DS 9.0 - Plugin loader.zip & ActionReplay.zip
- Included in this repository or you can download from here

2. Make sure you already installed the latest Boot9strap and Luma CFW and have a firmware of 11.4 or higher.

3. Rename any existing boot.firm in the root of your SD card to boot.firm.bak in case you want to go back, then drag the boot.firm from Luma3DS 9.0 - Plugin loader.zip into the root of your SD card

4. Place the contents from ActionReplay.zip into either
- sd:/luma/plugins/<Title ID of the game folder>/
- Name of the plugin must be plugin.plg if placed here.
- or sd:/luma/plugins/ActionReplay/
- Name of plugin must be ActionReplay.plg if placed here.
if placed here allows loading the plugin for all games if no specific plugin is found.

5. Either download or clone this repository or search in the cheats folder for the game you want to cheat on and download the .txt file in the folder
6. Move the .txt file to either
- sd:/cheats/
txt files are conveniently already named correctly if placing here
- or place along side plugin.plg from #4 and rename the .txt to cheats.txt
7. Use your button combo to load up rosalina menu (default is usually L+Down+select) and enable plugin loader if it isn't already and then load up your game
- If you get a green screen during load then it worked
To open CTRPluginFramework menu press select once in-game and click on Action Replay button to see the cheats.
